Hi, my name is Bryan Vasquez and i've been coding for about 4 years now .I have an associates degree from westchester community college and My work has mainly been on small projects in python, c++, and java. The largest project ive done has been a racecar garage simulator in java, which stored all the user information and cars manufactored in the last 15 years in a mySQL database. The front end was written in javaFX. One of the most important classses ive taken so far was Data Structures. That class did not only teach me about containers and pointers etc, it taught me how to think like a programmer. It taught ne how to analyze a problem, and address it in an articulate manor. 

I believe where i will be using what i learn in this course will be in the job finding part of my career. I had never done anything with github, i had heard of it but it always seemed so abstract and i never saw the time that i would use it. Learning how to store my work and put it on display for an employer to see will be extremely helpful in getting my career on its feet. Ive always been intimidated by the idea of having to design something and having to make it visually appealing. This class is my chance to hone in on my skills in css and other UI tools to make myself more confident as a programmer, even though my interest is in back end development.
